I am assistant professor at the [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.dinfo.unifi.it/) of the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html) where I am part of the [Software Technologies Lab](https://stlab.dinfo.unifi.it/).

My research interests span diverse areas, including:
* Software systems and software architectures
* Model-Driven engineering
* Quantitative evaluation of stochastic models

My purpose is to bridge these research areas by applying quantitative evaluation methods to software systems for the study of non-functional requirements, focusing on reliability. Recently, I have been also exploring the field of efficient cloud computing and edge computations solutions, with particular emphasis on the Mobile Edge Computing paradigm.
