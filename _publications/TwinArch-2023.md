abstract: 'With the evergrowing popularization of complex, distributed, and heterogeneous networks, how to architect and monitor networking environments is becoming a crucial open problem. In this context, digital twins can be used to mimic the structure and behavior of physical network. Albeit digital twin references architectures exist for other domains, to date, no comprehensive reference architecture for digital twins in the networking context was yet established. In this position paper, we discuss the current need for a reference network digital twin reference architecture, and describe the essential element in the road ahead to design it. We open the paper with the results of a preliminary survey we conducted to investigate the need for the reference architecture, the key information it should convey, and more practical insights on how to design it. Among other results, the survey corroborated that current standards are not best fitted to model network digital twin, and that a new reference architecture is needed. Following, we document our position on the need of a reference architecture for network digital twins. Our discussion is outlined as three main facets, namely (i) digital twins of what, for what, and how to deploy them. As conclusion, we outline our vision on the reference architecture, and the main research steps we plan to undertake to tackle the problem. As end goal, we intend to reach out to both networking and digital twin software architecture communities, towards the joint establishment of a future proof digital twin network architecture.'
