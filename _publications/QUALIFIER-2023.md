abstract: 'Background: Albeit the growing academic and industrial interest in microservice architectures and technical debt, to date no study aimed to investigate the evolution characteristics of technical debt in software-intensive systems based on such architecture. Aims: The goal of this study is to understand how technical debt evolves in microservice-based software-intensive systems, in terms of (i) evolution trends, and (ii) relation between technical debt and number of microservices. 
Method: We adopt a case study based on an application comprising 13 microservices, 977 commits, and 38k lines of code. The research method is based on repository mining and automated source code analysis complemented via manual code inspection. Results: While long periods of development without TD increase are observed, TD overall increases in
time. TD variations can happen regardless of the number of microservices and development activity considered in a commit. TD and number of microservices are strongly correlated, albeit not always. Adding (or removing) a microservice has a similar impact on TD regardless of the number of microservices already present in a software-intensive system. Conclusions: Adherence to microservice architecture principles might keep technical debt compartmentalized within microservices and hence more manageable. Developers should pay keen attention to the technical debt they may introduce, regardless of the number of microservice they touch with a commit and the development activity they carry out. Keeping technical debt constant during the evolution of a microservice-based architecture is possible, but the growth of technical debt while a software-intensive systems becomes bigger and more complex might be inevitable.'
