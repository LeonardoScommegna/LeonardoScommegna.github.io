abstract: 'Software rejuvenation is a proactive maintenance technique that counteracts software aging by restarting a system, making selection of rejuvenation times critical to improve reliability without incurring excessive downtime costs.
Various stochastic models of Software Aging and Rejuvenation~(SAR) have been developed, mostly having an underlying stochastic process in the class of Continuous Time Markov Chains~(CTMCs), Semi-Markov Processes~(SMPs), and Markov Regenerative Processes~(MRGPs) under the enabling restriction, requiring that at most one general~(GEN), i.e.,~non-Exponential, timer be enabled in each state.
We present a SAR model with an underlying MRGP under the bounded regeneration restriction, allowing for multiple GEN timers to be concurrently enabled in each state.
This expressivity gain not only supports more accurate fitting of duration distributions from observed statistics, but also enables the definition of mixed rejuvenation strategies combining time-based and inspection-based policies, where the time to the next inspection or rejuvenation depends on the outcomes of diagnostic tests. 
Experimental results show that replacing GEN timers with Exponential timers with the same mean (to satisfy the enabling restriction) yields inaccurate rejuvenation policies, and that mixed rejuvenation outperforms time-based rejuvenation in maximizing reliability, though at the cost of an acceptable decrease in availability.'
