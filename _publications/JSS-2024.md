abstract: 'Context: When testing three-tiered architectures, strategies often rely on superficial information, e.g., black-box input. However, the correct behavior of software-intensive systems based on such architectural pattern also depends on the logic hidden behind the interface. Verifying the response process is thus often complex and requires ad-hoc strategies.
Objective: We propose an approach to identify faults hidden behind the presentation layer. The model-based approach uses an architectural abstraction called managed component Data Flow Graph (mcDFG). The mcDFG is aware of the interactions between all layers of the architecture and guides the generation of tests based on different mcDFG coverage criteria to identify faults in the business logic.
Method: To evaluate the approach viability, we consider a three-tiered web application and 32 faults. The fault detection capability is assessed by comparing a set of test suites created by following our method and a
set of test suites developed by utilizing traditional testing strategies.
Results: The collected data show that the proposed model-based approach is a viable option to identify faults hidden in the logic layer, as it can outperform standard strategies based solely on the presentation layer while keeping the number of test cases and number of interactions per test case low.'
