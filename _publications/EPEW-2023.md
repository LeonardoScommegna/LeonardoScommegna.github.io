abstract: 'Resource scaling is widely employed in cloud computing to adapt system operation to internal (i.e., application) and external (i.e., environment) changes. We present a quantitative approach for coordinated vertical scaling of resources in cloud computing workflows, aimed at satisfying an agreed Service Level Objective (SLO) by improving the workflow end-to-end (e2e) response time distribution. Workflows consist of IaaS services running on dedicated clusters, statically reserved before execution. Services are composed through sequence, choice/merge, and balanced split/join blocks, and have generally distributed (i.e., non-Markovian) durations possibly over bounded supports, facilitating fitting of analytical distributions from observed data. Resource allocation is performed through an efficient heuristics guided by the mean makespans of sub-workflows. The heuristics performs a top-down visit of the hierarchy of services, and it exploits an efficient compositional method to derive the response time distribution and the mean makespan of each sub-workflow. Experimental results on a workflow with high concurrency degree appear promising for feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.'
