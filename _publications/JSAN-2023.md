abstract: 'Mobile online gaming is constantly growing in popularity and is expected to be one of the most important applications of upcoming sixth generation networks. Nevertheless, it remains challenging for game providers to support it, mainly due to its intrinsic and ever-stricter need for service continuity in the presence of user mobility. In this regard, this paper proposes a machine learning strategy to forecast user channel conditions, aiming at guaranteeing a seamless service whenever a user is involved in a handover, i.e., moving from the coverage area of one base station towards another. In particular, the proposed channel condition prediction approach involves the exploitation of an echo state network, an efficient class of recurrent neural network, that is empowered with a genetic algorithm to perform parameter optimization. The echo state network is applied to improve user decisions regarding the selection of the serving base station, avoiding game breaks as much as possible to lower game lag time. The validity of the proposed framework is confirmed by simulations in comparison to the long short-term memory approach and another alternative method, aimed at thoroughly testing the accuracy of the learning module in forecasting user trajectories and in reducing game breaks or lag time, with a focus on a sixth generation network application scenario.'
