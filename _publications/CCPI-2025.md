abstract: 'The advent of 5G networks has accelerated the adoption of cloud-native principles in telecommunications, enabling greater flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in network management. Central to this evolution is the integration of Network Function Virtualization (NFV), which transforms traditional hardware-dependent network functions into Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) composed of modular, interconnected microservices. While this approach offers significant advantages, it introduces challenges in resource allocation, VNF scaling, and service placement, particularly in Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) environments. 
This paper presents the ADAPTO framework, which provides an orchestration framework for optimizing computational and network resources across distributed edge and central clouds.
We detail updated components within ADAPTO that enable dynamic resource monitoring, modeling of microservice dependencies using service call graphs, and decision-making for VNF scaling and placement. These innovations ensure optimized resource utilization, reduced latency, and enhanced reliability in cloud-native telecommunications networks.'
