abstract: "Background: Over the past decade, microservices have surged in popularity within software engineering. From a research viewpoint, mining studies are frequently employed to assess the evolution of diverse microservice properties. Despite the growing need, a validated static method to swiftly identify microservices seems to be currently missing in the literature.

Aims: We present CLAIM, a lightweight static approach that analyzes configuration files to identify microservices in Dockerized environments, specifically designed with mining studies in mind.

Method: To validate CLAIM, we conduct an empirical experiment comprising 20 repositories, 160 microservices, and 13k commits. A priori and manually defined ground truths are used to evaluate CLAIM's microservice identification effectiveness and efficiency.

Results: CLAIM detects microservices with an accuracy of 82.0%, reports a median execution time of 61ms per commit, and requires in the worst case scenario 125.5s to analyze the history of a repository comprising 1509 commits. With respect to its closest competitor, CLAIM shines most in terms of false positive reduction (-40%).

Conclusions: While not able to reconstruct a microservice archi- tecture in its entirety, CLAIM is an effective and efficient option to swiftly identify microservices in Dockerized environments, and seems especially fitted for software evolution mining studies"
